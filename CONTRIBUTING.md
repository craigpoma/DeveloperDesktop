## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, instead contact the author via a private channel to communicate the issue.
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/cpoma/DeveloperDesktop/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/cpoma/DeveloperDesktop/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Thanks!
